1. Classic ciphers

--- Ceacar cipher
a ceacar cipher is used to decrypt or encrypt a message using the
alphabet and shift. Where the shift is just shifting a letter to another 
letter futher along the alphabet. 


-- monoalphabetic cipher
works the same as the Ceasar Cipher, except it's done by shuffeling and matching
the most frequent letter in the given message to the most frequent used letter in the english
alphabet. from HELLO to BDHHT. this means since the most frequent is H 
we can now guess that all H'es are equal to E. the most frequent.
this would mean that:
AHD - encrypted.
HEI - Decrypted


--- Vigenere cipher
Key is a sequence of numbers, which corresponds to how many 
steps the letter is going to be shuffled. the key will
expand to fit the length of the message. 

-- Stream
LFSR, 
linear feedback register.
contains functions. 
loops some time because the number of possible states is finite.
the steps it takes to loop back is a cycle of length steps
Polynomial.
the largest exponent is the number of cells. the remaining
is the number of cells who are connected to the feedback line.
the maximal length is 2^m -1
attack by known plaintext attack. since lfsr is a keystream generator
xoring the plaintext and part of the cipher text we can recover
100 bits of the keystream. 
recover connections in its feedback line. 

----Elgamal digital signature scheme.

RSA scheme:

- pick two large primes p,q
- compute n = pq and m = phi(n) = (p-1)*(q-1)
- pick e in Zm with gcd(e,m) = 1
- take d = e^-1 mod m 
- publish(n,e) as the public key and preserve d as a private key

----- signature 
given a message x in Zn
compute s = x^d mod n 
the signed message is (x,s)

-- verification
given a pair (x,s) of a message and a signature
compute x' = s^e mod n 
accept the message if and only if x = x'

---DSA

Pollard's method 
B = g^x mod p
x = i2-i1 / j1-j2 mod p

verify:
s = (x-dr)*Ke mod (p-1)
B = g^d mod p 
2^12 mod 29 = 7

t = B^r*r^s mod p 

# first verify r. so we have a key for r.
# now we use this r to compute s. and to check the correct key here
# we need a new key so that 

DHKE first. 

Boolean:

-- Gold function f(x) = x^3 in F2^n
-- that is as an (n,n) function is known to have differential 
uniformity equal to 2. the best possible value. for any n 
truth table for n = 4, n = 5, n = 6
given as a list (2^n-1)


x^4 = x^2+2^2
it has roots
so if we write x^4 = x^
