Tasl 6.3.1 Can be found in Pam8USignatureAST, but my thought was that 
IntrinsicsYarn1 would be for both 6.3.1 and 6.3.2

Task 6.3.3 can be found in IntrinsicsYarn2



Task 6.3.4

The calculators are too specific for the types, this could cause bugs and mistakes
when adding other stuff to the program. They can also produce wrong anwsers because They
still use some of the same modules, which can affect each calculator different. 
It can also be harder for a user to know which unit or variable they should use to 
preform the calculations. For instance Calculator 1 can have issues with loosing the unit
name while accessing functions that makes the input for the function wrong.

The second calculator can't accept other forms of valuedomains than Double (This isn't a big issue),
but what if the user wants to use variables for calculating things instead of literal doubles.
